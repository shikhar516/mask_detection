# mask_detection
COVID-19 face mask detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Python, Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV.
Detect the person is wearing mask or not.
I have a Data set for approx 700 With mask and without mask each
There are 3 steps I have created this whole project in.
Step 1.0: Data preprocessing
Step 2.0: Training the CNN
Step 3.0: Detecting Masks

I have made the code self explanatory.

Also you can check my website stringlab.org

I am able to acheive ~97%-98% accuracy 
Below are some results
